Raxon Steelwright
![Raxon01.jpeg](Raxon01.jpeg)

# 2️⃣ 𝗥𝗮𝗰𝗲: 
Human Cyborg (a fusion of human and advanced nanite-based technology)

# 3️⃣ 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀: 
Nanite Controller (a specialized class capable of harnessing the power of nanites to manipulate technology and the environment)

# 4️⃣ 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆: 
Raxon grew up in the wastelands. His father was a mercenary and his mother ran a brothel. He integrated his own creation, advanced nanites, into his body, both for business and pleasure. This granted him incredible powers and transformed him into a human-cyborg hybrid.

𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Raxon's upbringing in the harsh world has hardened him, making him resourceful, cunning, and tough. However, he still values loyalty and compassion, often assisting those who can't defend themselves. His connection with nanites has given him an insatiable curiosity about technology and its potential uses. In social situations, Raxon is intimidating and persuasive, not easily trusting others.

# 5️⃣ 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗔𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀:
- 𝗡𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Raxon can manipulate nanites to create structures, weapons, and devices on the fly.

> 🏺🗺️: 🤖✨ In Dungeons & Dragons, the closest matching class to a Technomancer would likely be a combination of the Artificer and the Wizard.

## The Artificer: 
This class specializes in the creation and manipulation of magical items, devices, and constructs. They excel at using their knowledge of arcane engineering and infusion magic to enhance their creations and imbue them with magical abilities. This class can represent the technology manipulation aspects of a Technomancer.

# Here are some key features of the Artificer class:
1. Spellcasting: Artificers have access to a variety of spells that can represent their technological control and enhancement abilities.
2. Infuse Item: Artificers can imbue mundane items with magical properties, which can mirror the Technomancer's ability to manipulate tech with nanites.
3. Mechanical Servant (Battle Smith subclass): The ability to create and control a construct companion could represent a nanite-based construct for the Technomancer.

# The Wizard: 
While Artificers focus on magical items, Wizards specialize in the arcane arts and spellcasting. The Wizard's School of Transmutation can represent the Technomancer's nanite manipulation and control capabilities.

## Some key features from the Wizard class:
1. Spellcasting: Wizards have access to a broad range of spells that can reflect the Technomancer's nanite manipulation and control abilities.
2. Transmutation Savant (Transmutation subclass): This ability allows a Wizard to learn and transcribe Transmutation spells at half the time and cost, representing the Technomancer's expertise in nanotechnology.
3. Minor Alchemy (Transmutation subclass): This ability allows a Wizard to temporarily alter the structure of mundane materials, which could mirror the Technomancer's ability to manipulate matter via nanites.

By combining aspects and abilities from both the Artificer and the Wizard classes, especially the Transmutation subclass of the Wizard, you could create a custom Technomancer class or reskin the mechanics of these classes to fit the Technomancer theme in your campaign.
