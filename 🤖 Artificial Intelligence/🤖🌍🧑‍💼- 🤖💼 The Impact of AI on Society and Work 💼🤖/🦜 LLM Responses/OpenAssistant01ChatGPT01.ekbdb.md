The growing prevalence of Artificial Intelligence in our daily lives continues to spark discussion around its societal effects. With this technology becoming increasingly integrated into industries worldwide, there is great interest in discovering both positive and negative consequences brought about by advancements in AI. However, one area often overlooked during these conversations centers on individuals with disabilities. This essay will discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks that arise from utilizing Artificial Intelligence among those living with impairments before delving into potential solutions designed to mitigate negative outcomes. Ultimately, though AI has the capacity to improve life for disabled people, ethical questions surrounding privacy and autonomy cannot be ignored. A balance must be struck between maximizing accessibility through innovative software without violating fundamental rights each person possesses. Thus far, little attention has been paid toward evaluating this sensitive issue, but careful analysis reveals how artificial intelligence presents unique opportunities for improving life quality while introducing challenges not yet fully addressed by policymakers and scientists alike. As such, continued investigation of these topics is necessary if society wishes to craft comprehensive guidelines governing the intersection of assistive technology and disability law.
