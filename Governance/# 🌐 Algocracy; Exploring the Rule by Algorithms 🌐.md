# 🌐 Algocracy: Exploring the Rule by Algorithms 🌐

## 📝 Summary
Algocracy refers to a system of governance where algorithms make decisions or influence policy-making. It has sparked debate on ethics, transparency, and the role of human agency in decision-making processes. 🤖🏛️🗣️

## 🔑 Core Concepts
- 1️⃣ 🖥️ Algorithms: Sets of rules or instructions used for calculations, data processing, and automated decision-making.
- 2️⃣ 🌐 Governance: The process of decision-making and policy implementation in a system.
- 3️⃣ 📊 Data-driven decisions: Decisions based on data analysis rather than human intuition.

## 🐚 Shells
- 1️⃣ 🤖 Algorithmic bias: Unintended consequences of algocracy, such as discrimination or inequality.
- 2️⃣ 🛡️ Algorithmic accountability: Ensuring algorithms are transparent, auditable, and responsive to public concerns.
- 3️⃣ 🧠 Human-machine collaboration: Combining human intuition and algorithmic efficiency for balanced decision-making.
